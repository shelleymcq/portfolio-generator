## Description
This CLI will allow a user to create a simple portfolio from the command line. The inquirer npm package is used to prompt the user for project details and then a ready to deploy ```index.html``` file is generated. 
## Story
I am redoing particularly interesting or challenging class projects from scratch to see how far I've come in my learning to code journey. This project was never completed in class, but sounded fun. The original acceptance criteria was a simply designed contact site autogenerated from the command line. I included the functionality to add a single sample project and links to bring a little more interest to the page. Next I would like the user to be able to add multiple projects and jazz up the styling a bit.
